Arduino challenge was a competition setup by the local tech startup tackling both tech and marketting skills.
University students were mentoring the participant in both areas and the goal is to come up with a tech product and can successfully pitch the product.
Despite not being able to be on the podium, there were many things that I learnt from this experience.
