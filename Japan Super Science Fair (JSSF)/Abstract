I have seen problems with how inefficient human have been using land, and it is important to make the land use effective because the population is growing yet the land doesnâ€™t. I had an idea from a principle of how we can extend living area vertically, and it is to do the same thing to farmland. A farm tower which depends on technology like watering automation, light control, and potentially a sorting system.
