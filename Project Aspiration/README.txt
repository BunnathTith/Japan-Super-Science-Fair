Project Aspiration is a national-wide project held by the Ministry of Education Youth and Sport in Cambodia. This project is about creating a research paper, written in Khmer, on various topics.
I decided to take up the project "Reinforce soil in resident building". It was to test the feasibility of using just granule soil reenforce with layers of geogrid.
The project ends up in the 80-90-mark-out-of-100 category
Since it was my first time having to go through such a rigorous process, I was happy with the result given the duration was only 2 months. I learned a lot about tackling research papers and am definately willing to do more of this.
